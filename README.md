This final project will be extending an existing Needleman-Wunsch aligner from Github https://github.com/drdrsh/Needleman-Wunsch, to support fitting alignment and local alignment in addition to global alignment. This project will utilize the existing frontend visual design of the aligner, while adding options to perform the fitting and local alignment algorithms.
